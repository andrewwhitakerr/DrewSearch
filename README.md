Under the guidance of my professor, I developed a basic search engine in Java that emulates the early PageRank algorithm. PageRank, originally created by Google’s founders, ranks web pages based on their importance determined by the number and quality of incoming links — much like how a research paper’s significance is measured by its citations. In my implementation, the program simulates web crawling to index pages and their hyperlinks. I used data structures like TreeMaps and HashMaps to store and manage the relationships between pages and the links pointing to them. The algorithm then iteratively computes a score for each page by updating these scores based on the pages that link to them, effectively ranking the pages according to their authority. This project genuinely challenged me and deepened my understanding of data structures, algorithms, and Java programming.

Some of the Java classes were provided by my professor; I will mark which ones they are on GitHub as soon as I get the chance.
