Under the guidance of my professor, I developed a basic search engine in Java that emulates the early PageRank algorithm. In my implementation, the program simulates web crawling to index pages and their hyperlinks. I used data structures like TreeMaps and HashMaps to store and manage the relationships between pages and their relevance to the search query. The algorithm then iteratively computes a score for each page, ranking the pages according to their authority. This project genuinely challenged me and deepened my understanding of data structures, algorithms, and Java programming.

Multiple Java classes were provided by my professor; I have marked which ones they are. **The heart of the search algorithm -- my part of the assignment -- is found in NotGPT.java**
